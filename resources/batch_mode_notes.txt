create a "batch mode" that prevents any dialogs or other user interactions. 

allow for passing a folder of PDFs as an argument.
	if a folder is passed
		set batchMode true
		don't display the order number dialog.
		for each file in folder
			parse order number
			execute BuildMockup(order number)
			if any errors or missing files (that cause a dialog) during build mockup
				create a readme file indicating 
					which garment/graphic/asset could not be found
					what the error was and which order/design number had the error
			log some data about the mockup that was built
				perhaps a small database that holds general data like number of total mockups processed, total time spent processing, graphics opened, number of errors
	else
		proceed with build mockup as normal
